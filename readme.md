# Export data to Android API 29+

This was created using VS 2019 Mac version 8.10. This will work "the old way" with API 28, but use the new [MediaStore](https://developer.android.google.cn/reference/android/provider/MediaStore.html) [insert](https://developer.android.google.cn/reference/android/content/ContentResolver#insert(android.net.Uri,%20android.content.ContentValues)) method to add a file into the Android Download directory.

The article describing how to update, query and delete a file using Xamarin using Android MediaStore is coming soon.
